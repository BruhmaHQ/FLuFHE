# FLuFHE - Federated Leaning using FHE
FLuFHE - Federated Learning using FHE to use decentralized model training and protect it against inference and stealth attacks.

## Federated Learning 
Explain advantages of FL

## Issues with Federated Learning
Explain issues of FL -stealth attack, inference attack and aggregator has access

## Flufhe - improving Federated Learning using fully homomorphic encryption
Performing aggregation on encrypted models so aggregator does not get access to actual model and only
